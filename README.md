#Foodistic - Smart Recipe Suggestion Tool

#The system works as follows:
● The user enters the ingredient they have on the frontend.
● The frontend sends the ingredient to the backend.
● The backend retrieves data about recipes from the Forkify API.
● The backend processes the data and returns a list of recipes to the
frontend.
● The frontend displays the list of recipes to the user.

The system is scalable and can be easily extended to support more users and
more recipes. The system is also secure and uses HTTPS to protect user data.
The system is designed to be easy to maintain and update. The frontend code is
written in React Js, which is a popular JavaScript framework. The backend code
is written in RestAPIs, which is a standard way of creating APIs.
